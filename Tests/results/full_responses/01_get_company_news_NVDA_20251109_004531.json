      "summary": "STORY: OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has signed a seven-year, $38 billion deal to buy cloud services from Amazon.It's the company's first big push to power its AI ambitions after a restructuring last week that gave it greater operational and financial freedom.The agreement, announced on Monday, will give OpenAI access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its artificial intelligence models.It underscores the AI industry's insatiable appetite for computing power as companies race to build systems that can rival or surpass human intelligence.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said the startup is committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop 30 gigawatts of computing resources - enough to roughly power 25 million U.S. homes.The deal is also a major vote of confidence for Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, which some investors feared had fallen behind rivals Microsoft and Google in the AI race.Those fears were somewhat eased by strong growth reported in the September quarter.Amazon shares hit an all-time high on Monday, with the company set to add nearly $140 billion to its market value.",
